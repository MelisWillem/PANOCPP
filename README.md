 # PANOCPP
Panoc algorithm in c++ using EIGEN

## Taks ongoing development

1. Implement L-BFGS using EIGEN (with tests poly/rosenbrock ) [development completed]
2. Implement proximal gradient using EIGEN (with tests poly/rosenbrock ) [ongoing development]
3. Implement FBE (with tests)
4. Implement Panoc (with tests poly/rosenbrock )
5. Compare performance CPanoc with PANOCPP
6. Compare performance ipopt vs PANOCPP
